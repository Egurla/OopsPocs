##Abstraction
Abstraction means that you hide the implementation details from the code that uses a class or method.
abstract is used to mark classes that have methods that are only declared and not implemented. 
It is "abstract" in the sense that they cannot be instantiated,we cannot create any instances out of these classes 


##Polymorphism
In simple words, polymorphism is the ability by which,we can create functions or reference variables which behaves 
differently in different programmatic context.

##Inheritance
Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.but 
Members of a class that are declared private are not inherited by subclasses of that class. Only members of a class that are 
declared protected or public are inherited by subclasses declared in a package other than the one in which the class is declared

##Encapsulation
Encapsulation simply means binding object state(properties) and behavior(methods) together. If you are creating class, you are doing encapsulation
